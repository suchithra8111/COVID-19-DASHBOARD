# COVID-19-DASHBOARD
POWER BI MAIN PROJECT

# INTRODUCTION

## This repository hosts a dynamic COVID-19 analytics dashboard built using Power BI, aiming to deliver extensive insights into the ongoing global pandemic. The dashboard is meticulously crafted to present a holistic view of the COVID-19 situation, covering overarching trends worldwide, detailed country-specific data, concise monthly summaries, and a specialized focus on the United States. It offers users a seamless experience navigating through critical statistics and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the pandemic's progression and its impact across various regions.

# Optimized COVID-19 Data Pipeline in Power BI

## Preprocessing:

## *Data Refinement:
Streamlined the dataset by eliminating duplicate entries, rectifying missing values, and filtering out extraneous columns to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

 ##*Integration of Computed Metrics:
Introduced calculated columns encompassing vital metrics like mortality rate, recovery rate, and active cases, enhancing the dataset's depth and analytical capabilities. Implemented dynamic measures to capture daily fluctuations in new cases, deaths, and recoveries, furnishing real-time insights.

## * Architectural Framework:

## * Structural Mapping:Forged a robust data model, interlinking tables through coherent relationships predicated on shared attributes such as country/region and date. Engineered hierarchies and meticulously sorted data fields to augment the ease of exploration and interpretation within the Power BI environment.
